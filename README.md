# chess

A simple program to play chess with friends on the command line or through a
simple user interface.

TODO:
- Implement correct movement with path()
- Return removed pieces via Tile.java and Board.java
- Implement check and checkmate checks

MAYBE:
- Implement variable starting positions for pieces
- Make the methods more general so as to separate the UI from the game
